This is a small suite of scripts and patches to build a musl libc
cross-compiler. For the impatient, ./build.sh should build a cross compiler to
/opt/cross/<arch>-linux-musl, no muss, no fuss. Otherwise, you can edit
config.sh to make cross-compilers to other architectures, and even copy
config.sh to another directory then run build.sh from there to avoid polluting
the source dir.

Some further notes:

* For ARM, you must set the triple to arm-linux-musleabi (eabi is the important
  bit here)

* You can set versions of binutils, GCC or musl in config.sh with:
  BINUTILS_VERSION=<version>
  GCC_VERSION=<version>
  MUSL_VERSION=<version>

* You can use a git checkout of musl with:
  MUSL_VERSION=<git tag or commit>
  MUSL_GIT=yes
